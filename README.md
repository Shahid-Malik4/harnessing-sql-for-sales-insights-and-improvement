# Introduction
ðŸ“Š The "Harnessing SQL for Sales Insights and Improvement" project involved comprehensive analysis of sales data extracted from SQL Server, imported into MySQL for data preparation, cleaning, normalization, and in-depth analysis using various SQL commands and functions. The project aimed to derive actionable insights, identify key sales metrics, and explore sales trends using advanced SQL functionalities.


# Background
Objective: To perform extensive sales analysis by leveraging MySQL's advanced SQL functionalities, including basic commands, GROUP BY, HAVING, Common Table Expressions (CTE), joins, subqueries, and window functions. The analysis focused on key features such as best-selling items, top-paying customers, sales trends by company, category, territory, time series analysis, and significant KPIs.


### The questions I wanted to answer:

1. Distribution of medals among male and female athletes?
2. What countries participated in almost every Olympic Season?
3. Participants and Events by Season?
4. Medals distribution by Athletes, Countries and Sports throughout the Year's?
5. Athletes Participations and Medal Winning Analysis?


# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the analysis, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **MySQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **MS SQL Server:** My go-to for analysis and visualization.
- **Excel:** The handy tool for Data manipulation.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# Project Phases:

### 1. Data Extraction and Preparation in MySQL:
Extracted raw sales data from SQL Server and imported it into MySQL for data cleaning, preparation, and normalization. Conducted data cleaning and normalization to improve performance and reduce redundancy.

### 2. SQL Analysis with Advanced Functionalities:
Utilized a wide array of SQL functionalities for in-depth analysis: Basic SELECT, WHERE, FROM Commands: Extracted specific data subsets based on conditions. Advanced GROUP BY, HAVING: Conducted group-wise aggregations and filtering. Common Table Expressions (CTE): Created temporary result sets for complex queries. Joins and Subqueries: Combined data from multiple tables and performed nested queries. Window Functions (SUM, AVG, RANK, ROW_NUMBER, LEAD, LAG): Calculated aggregated values and performed ranking and analytical operations.

### 3. Key Features and KPI Analysis:
* Best Selling Item Analysis: Identified top-performing products based on sales volume or revenue.
* Top Paying Customers: Recognized customers contributing the most to overall sales revenue.
Sales Analysis by Company, Category, Territory: Conducted comprehensive sales breakdown across different segments.
* Time Series Analysis: Examined sales trends over time, including sales by year and sales/orders trends.
* Revenue and Profit Over Time: Analyzed revenue and profit trends to gauge business performance.
* Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Calculated and presented total sales, total profit, total products, total customers, total invoices, and total quantity sold.

### 4. Insights and Outcomes:
Derived insights into top-selling products and their performance across categories and territories. Identified high-value customers significantly impacting overall sales revenue. Analyzed sales trends and patterns by company, category, and territory, providing actionable insights for strategic decision-making. Gained a comprehensive understanding of sales performance metrics and KPIs to assess business health and make informed decisions.
