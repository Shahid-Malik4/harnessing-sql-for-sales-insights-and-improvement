# Introduction
ðŸ“Š The project involved comprehensive analysis of sales data extracted from SQL Server, imported into MySQL for data preparation, cleaning, normalization, and in-depth analysis using various SQL commands and functions. The project aimed to derive actionable insights, identify key sales metrics, and explore sales trends using advanced SQL functionalities.


# Background
**Objective:** To perform extensive sales analysis by leveraging MySQL's advanced SQL functionalities, including basic commands, GROUP BY, HAVING, Common Table Expressions (CTE), joins, subqueries, and window functions. The analysis focused on key features such as best-selling items, top-paying customers, sales trends by company, category, territory, time series analysis, and significant KPIs.


### The questions I wanted to answer:

1. What are best selling items?
2. What are top paying customers?
3. What is YTY revenue difference?
4. What are top 3 customers from each Head?
5. What is the ratio of YTY sales company?


# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the analysis, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **MySQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# Project Phases:

### 1. Data Extraction and Preparation in MySQL:
Extracted raw sales data from SQL Server and imported it into MySQL for data cleaning, preparation, and normalization. Conducted data cleaning and normalization to improve performance and reduce redundancy.

### 2. SQL Analysis with Advanced Functionalities:
Utilized a wide array of SQL functionalities for in-depth analysis: Basic SELECT, WHERE, FROM Commands: Extracted specific data subsets based on conditions. Advanced GROUP BY, HAVING: Conducted group-wise aggregations and filtering. Common Table Expressions (CTE): Created temporary result sets for complex queries. Joins and Subqueries: Combined data from multiple tables and performed nested queries. Window Functions (SUM, AVG, RANK, ROW_NUMBER, LEAD, LAG): Calculated aggregated values and performed ranking and analytical operations.

### 3. Key Features and KPI Analysis:
* **Best Selling Item Analysis:** Identified top-performing products based on sales volume or revenue.
* **Top Paying Customers:** Recognized customers contributing the most to overall sales revenue.
Sales Analysis by Company, Category, Territory: Conducted comprehensive sales breakdown across different segments.
* **Time Series Analysis:** Examined sales trends over time, including sales by year and sales/orders trends.
* **Revenue and Profit Over Time:** Analyzed revenue and profit trends to gauge business performance.
* **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Calculated and presented total sales, total profit, total products, total customers, total invoices, and total quantity sold.

### 1. What are best selling items?
```sql
SELECT
	itemname,
    SUM(total) AS total_amount
FROM
	orderdetails
GROUP BY itemname
ORDER BY total_amount DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Here's the breakdown of query results
- **Sticky Notes**, **Ballpoint Pens** and **Mechanical Pencils** remain top selling items with a great profit margin.

| Item Name                  | Total Amount   |
|----------------------------|----------------|

    SUM(amount) AS amount
FROM orders
GROUP BY party
ORDER BY amount DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Here's the breakdown of query results
- Customer's like **John Smith** and **Emily Johnson** remain top paying customers with millions of sales and trade.

### 3. What is YTY revenue difference??
```sql
WITH cte AS
(
	SELECT
		YEAR(date) AS year,
        SUM(amount) AS revenue
	FROM orders
    GROUP BY year
)
SELECT
	year,
    revenue,
    LAG(revenue) OVER(ORDER BY year) AS previous_year_revenue,
    revenue - LAG(revenue) OVER(ORDER BY year) AS revenue_difference,
    CONVERT((
		(
			revenue - LAG(revenue) OVER(ORDER BY year)
		) / LAG(revenue) OVER(ORDER BY year) *100
